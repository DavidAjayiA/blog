          On Manifesting: It's Not That You Don't Want It Enough. It's <br />
          That Your Habit Sucks!
        </p>
        <div class="img">

      <section class="main">
        <p class="one">
         <span class="overall"> <span class="pr">W</span>hen it comes to manifesting…It’s not that you don’t want it enough.
          <span class="br">It’s that your habits suck.</span> <br /></span>  <span class="three">Because remember: manifesting is
          CO-CREATING with the universe. Which means… You still have to do the
    <!-- <br /> -->work on the material plane!</span>
        </p>

        <p class="two">
          One of the reasons why we don’t get the things we want is that we
          don’t have HABITS or ROUTINES that lead us down that
          <!-- <br /> -->
          path.
        </p>

        <p class="two">
          For example, if you want a flourishing business, you need to work on
          it every day. If you want a passionate relationship,
          <!-- <br /> -->
          you need habits that create sexual chemistry and rapport. If you want
          a fit body, you need habits to support you, like <br />
          eating good food, sweating consistently, and pushing yourself outside
          your comfort zone.
        </p>

        <p class="two">
          Last night, I sat in bed journalling. I picked two areas of my life
          that I wanted to work on, and I asked myself the following <br />
          questions…
        </p>

        <ul class="second">
          <li>What do I want this area of my life to look like?</li>
          <li>What systems/routines are going to get me to these goals?</li>
          <li>What is blocking me?</li>
          <li>What beliefs need to be shifted and transformed?</li>
        </ul>

        <p class="two">
          We need vision so we know where we’re going, and then we need to
          reverse engineer it and ask ourselves, ‘What will this <br />
          require of me? What changes to my daily habits do I need to make to
          get this thing I want?’ Some of the changes might be <br />
          minute little tweaks! But some might require a lifestyle overhaul.
        </p>

        <p class="two">
          The place where it gets tricky is asking ourselves what beliefs need
          to be shifted. In other words, what STORIES are you <br />
          telling yourself every day that cause you to have the habits that are
          getting you the results you have NOW?
        </p>

        <p class="two">
          For example, if you put more energy into your work than your
          relationship, why is that? Is it because you think men leave <br />
          you but your work never will? Is it because you believe being in a
          relationship spells the end of your freedom? Is it because <br />
          you fear intimacy and you use work to hold people at arm’s length?
        </p>

        <p class="two">
          PHEW! That’s some real talk. And that’s also where EFT/tapping comes
          in. Once we know what is driving our dysfunction, <br />
          we can use tapping to FACE it, own it, even find the humor in it. And
          then we can reprogram ourselves. Choose new beliefs <br />
          and new priorities. Create habits that will lead us to what we really
          want. And the game is officially changed.
